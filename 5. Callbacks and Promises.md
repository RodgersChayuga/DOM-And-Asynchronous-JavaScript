# 5. Callbacks and Promises:

Callbacks and Promises are both mechanisms for handling asynchronous operations in JavaScript.

#### 5.1. What are callbacks and how do they work?

* **What are callbacks:** This are functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and are called when the asynchronous operation is completed. 

* **How do they work:** Callback functions are commonly used in JavaScript to handle asynchronous tasks such as fetching data from an API, processing files, or performing network requests.

> Suppose you want to fetch data from an API using the fetch() method. You would pass a callback function to the then() method, which would be executed when the data is retrieved from the API.

```Javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));

```


#### 5.2. Examples of using callbacks to handle asynchronous events.

> In this example, a callback function is registered as an event handler for a button click event. When the button is clicked, the callback function is executed.

* **Event Callback:**

```Javascript
const button = document.getElementById("myButton");

button.addEventListener("click", function(event) {
  console.log("Button clicked!");
});
```

#### 5.3. What are promises and how do they simplify asynchronous code?

* **What are promises:** Are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together.

> A Promise can be in one of three states: 
> `pending` - The Initial state, when the Promise is neither fulfilled nor rejected., 
> `fulfilled` - The state when the asynchronous operation completed successfully, and the Promise reurns a result., or 
> `rejected` - The state when the asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise returns an error.

* **How do they simplify asynchronous code:** 

Promises simplify asynchronous code by allowing you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together in a more readable and maintainable way. 

Instead of using nested callbacks, which can lead to callback hell, Promises allow you to chain multiple asynchronous operations together using the .then() and .catch() methods.

```Javascript
fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
  .then(response => {
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error('Network response was not ok');
    }
    return response.json();
  })
  .then(data => console.log(data))
  .catch(error => console.error(error));
```

>In this example, the fetch() function returns a Promise that resolves with a response object. The first .then() method checks if the response was successful and throws an error if not. If the response was successful, it parses the response as JSON and returns the data. The second .then() method logs the data to the console, and the .catch() method logs any errors that occurred during the Promise chain.
