# 4. Examples of using array methods on the DOM

### 1. Examples of using map() to manipulate DOM elements

##### 1.1. Change the text content of all paragraphs:

```Javascript
const paragraphs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('p'));
const newText = 'New text content';

const updatedParagraphs = paragraphs.map((p) => {
  p.textContent = newText;
  return p;
});
```

> In this example, we first select all the paragraph elements on the page using `querySelectorAll()`, and convert the
resulting **NodeList** to an array using `Array.from()`. We then use `map()` to loop over each paragraph element 
and set its `text
content` property to a new string. The updated paragaphs are returned as an array of DOM element

##### 1.2. Add a class to all images:

```Javascript
const images = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('img'));
const newClass = 'img-border';

const updatedImages = images.map((img) => {
  img.classList.add(newClass);
  return img;
});
```

>In this example, we select all the image elements on the page and convert the NodeList to an array. We then use `map()` to loop over each image element and add a new CSS class to it using `classList.add()`. The updated images are returned as an array of DOM elements.


### 2. Examples of using filter() to select specific DOM elements

##### 2.1. Select all links that open in a new tab:

```Javascript
const links = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('a'));

const newTabLinks = links.filter((link) => {
  return link.target === '_blank';
});
```

> In this example, we select all anchor elements on the page and convert the resulting NodeList to an array using `Array.from()`. We then use `filter()` to loop over each link element and check if its `target` attribute is set to `_blank`, which indicates that the link opens in a new tab. The links that meet this criteria are returned as an array of DOM elements.


##### 2.2. Select all images with a specific alt text:

```Javascript
const images = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('img'));
const altText = 'Example alt text';

const filteredImages = images.filter((img) => {
  return img.alt === altText;
});
```

> In this example, we select all the image elements on the page and convert the resulting NodeList to an array. We then use `filter()` to loop over each image element and check if its `alt` attribute is equal to a specific string. The images that meet this criteria are returned as an array of DOM elements.

##### 2.3. Select all input fields that are disabled:

```Javascript
const inputs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input'));

const disabledInputs = inputs.filter((input) => {
  return input.disabled === true;
});
```

> In this example, we select all the input elements on the page and convert the resulting NodeList to an array. We then use `filter()` to loop over each input element and check if its `disabled` attribute is set to `true`. The disabled input elements are returned as an array of DOM elements.

### 3. Examples of using reduce() to aggregate data from DOM elements

##### 3.1. Calculate the total height of all paragraphs:

```Javascript
const paragraphs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('p'));

const totalHeight = paragraphs.reduce((accumulator, current) => {
  const height = current.offsetHeight;
  return accumulator + height;
}, 0);
```

> In this example, we select all paragraph elements on the page and convert the resulting `NodeList` to an array `Array.from()`. We then use `reduce()` t loop over each paragraph element and calculate its `offsetHeight`, which gives us the height of the element inclunding borders and padding. We accumulate the total height of all paragraphs by adding each height value to the accumulator variable. We initialize the accumulator variable to `0` in the second argument of `reduce()`. The total height of all paragraphs is returned as a single value.

##### 3.2. Count the number of list items with a specific class:

```Javascript
const listItems = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('li'));
const className = 'highlight';

const count = listItems.reduce((accumulator, li) => {
  if (li.classList.contains(className)) {
    return accumulator + 1;
  } else {
    return accumulator;
  }
}, 0);
```

> In this example, we select all the list item elements on the page and convert the resulting `NodeList` to an array. We then use `reduce()` to loop over each list item element and check if it has a specific CSS class using `classList.contains()`. If it does, we add 1 to the accumulator variable, otherwise we leave it unchanged. The total count of list items with the specified class is returned as a single value.

##### 3.3. Calculate the sum of all input field values:

```Javascript
const inputs = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input[type="number"]'));

const sum = inputs.reduce((accumulator, input) => {
  const value = parseFloat(input.value) || 0;
  return accumulator + value;
}, 0);
```

> In this example, we select all the input elements with a `type` attribute of `"number"` on the page and convert the resulting NodeList to an array. We then use `reduce()` to loop over each input element and get its value using the `value` property. We convert the value to a number using `parseFloat()`, and if the result is `NaN`, we use `0` instead. The input field values are aggregated by adding them to an accumulator variable, starting at 0. The total sum of input field values is returned as a single value.


### 4. Best practices for using array methods on the DOM:

When working with array methods on the DOM (Document Object Model), it is important to follow some best practices to ensure that your code is `efficient`, `reliable`, and `maintainable`. Here are some best practices to consider:

4.1. Use **querySelectorAll()** to select elements: Rather than using `getElementsByTagName()` or `getElementsByClassName()`, which return a `live NodeList` that can cause issues when using array methods, use `querySelectorAll()` to select elements. This method returns a `static NodeList` that can be safely converted to an array.

4.2. Convert **NodeList to array:** When using array methods on the DOM, it is important to convert any NodeLists returned by methods like `querySelectorAll()` to an array using `Array.from()`. This will ensure that the resulting array can be used with array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.

4.3. Use the **correct array method:** When choosing which array method to use, consider what you want to achieve. For example, if you want to transform each element in an array, use `map()`. If you want to filter elements based on a condition, use `filter()`. If you want to aggregate data from an array, use `reduce()`.

4.4. Use **function declarations for callback functions:** When passing a callback function to an array method, it is generally better to use a function declaration rather than a function expression. This can make your code easier to read and maintain.

* **Function declarations** are hoisted to the top of their scope, which means that they can be called before they are defined in the code:

```Javascript
function sayHello(name) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
}

sayHello('John'); // output: Hello, John!
```
* **A function expression** is created by assigning a function to a variable, or using it as a value in an object or array. Function expressions are not hoisted, which means that they must be defined before they are called:

```Javascript
const sayHello = function(name) {
  console.log('Hello, ' + name + '!');
};

sayHello('John'); // output: Hello, John!

```
