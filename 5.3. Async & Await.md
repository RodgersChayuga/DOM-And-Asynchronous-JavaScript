# Async/Await:

Async/await is a newer syntax for handling promises. 
It allows us to write asynchronous code in a synchronous way.

```Javascript
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

async function orderProcess() {
  try {
    await api.createOrder(cart);
    await api.proceedToPayment();
    await api.showOrderSummary();
    await api.updateWallet();
  } catch (error) {
    console.log(error);
  }
}

orderProcess();
```

> The `async` keyword is used to define an asynchronous function, 
> and the `await` keyword is used to wait for a promise to resolve before moving 
> on to the next line of code. 
> The `try`/`catch` block is used to handle errors.

Async/await is even easier to read and write than promises.
