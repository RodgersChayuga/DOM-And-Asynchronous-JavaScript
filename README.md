### 1. [Introduction to the DOM](https://github.com/RodgersChayuga/DOM-And-Asynchronous-JavaScript/blob/main/Introduction%20to%20the%20DOM.md):
  * What is the DOM?
  * How does the DOM relate to HTML and CSS?
  * How does JavaScript interact with the DOM?
  * Examples of common DOM manipulations (e.g. changing text, adding/removing elements)
### 2. [Introduction to asynchronous JavaScript](https://github.com/RodgersChayuga/DOM-And-Asynchronous-JavaScript/edit/main/Introduction%20to%20asynchronous%20JavaScript.md):
  * What is asynchronous JavaScript?
  * Why is asynchronous JavaScript important for web development?
  * Examples of common asynchronous operations (e.g. fetching data from a server, user interactions)
### 3. Overview of array methods:
  * What are array methods?
  * Examples of common array methods (e.g. map(), filter(), reduce())
  * How do array methods work?
  * What are the benefits of using array methods?
### 4. Examples of using array methods on the DOM:
  * Examples of using map() to manipulate DOM elements
  * Examples of using filter() to select specific DOM elements
  * Examples of using reduce() to aggregate data from DOM elements
  * Best practices for using array methods on the DOM
### 5. Callbacks and Promises:
  * What are callbacks and how do they work?
  * Examples of using callbacks to handle asynchronous events
  * What are promises and how do they simplify asynchronous code?
  * Examples of using promises with array methods on the DOM
### 6. Best practices:
  * Using asynchronous methods to load data from the server
  * Updating the DOM only when data is ready
  * Avoiding long-running synchronous operations
  * Using error handling to handle asynchronous failures
  * Testing asynchronous code and troubleshooting common issues
