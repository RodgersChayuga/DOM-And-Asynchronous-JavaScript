# Solution: Promises

Promises allow us to chain async functions and they are easier to read and write.

### Example:

```Javascript
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart)
  .then(() => api.proceedToPayment())
  .then(() => api.showOrderSummary())
  .then(() => api.updateWallet())
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

>The `.then()` function is called only after the previous promise has resolved, and the `.catch()` function is called if any of the promises is rejected.

With promises, the code looks much cleaner and is easier to read
