# Solution: Promises

Promises allow us to chain async functions and they are easier to read and write.

### Example: Using the previous code

```Javascript
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart)
  .then(() => api.proceedToPayment())
  .then(() => api.showOrderSummary())
  .then(() => api.updateWallet())
  .catch((error) => console.log(error));
```

>The `.then()` function is called only after the previous promise has resolved, and the `.catch()` function is called if any of the promises is rejected.

With promises, the code looks much cleaner and is easier to read

# Promises.

This represent the completion stage of asynchronous operation in Javascript.
We we use Promises to figure out if an asynchronous function is completed or not, and the result of the outcome.

### The three possible states of a promise.

**1. Pending State:** Every starts of in the pending state, then it can go to one of the two states.
**2. Fulfilled State:** This is when the asynchronous action was successfully completed, and will get returned with the result of the operation.
**OR**
**3. Rejected State:** This is when an error occured and that the asynchronous was not able to complete successfully.
