# Callback Functions

JavaScript is a synchronous, single-threaded language, and it can only do one thing at a time. It has only one call stack and can execute only one thing at a time.

```Javascript
console.log("Rodgers");

console.log("Chayuga");

console.log("From Nairobi, Kenya");
```

### Example:
Suppose we are building an e-commerce website. It needs a cart.

```Javascript
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

```

> In the real world, this would be big objects, not just an array of strings.

#### Steps: How e-commerce works.

 * **CREATE ORDER**
 Suppose we have an API that creates an order, api.createOrder().
 * **PAYMENT**
 And another API to proceed to payment, api.proceedToPayment().

> Before we can purchase anything, we first need to create an order and then proceed to payment. There is a dependency between them.

Having these tow `APIs`:

```Javscript
api.createOrder();
api.proceedToPayment();
```

Callback comes into play to make it asynchronous, and the way we do it is by wrapping the `api.proceedToPayment()` API in a callback and executing it only if and only if the create order API has executed.

```Javascript
// Step No. 1: wrap the `api.proceedToPayment()` in a callback.
// Step No. 2: have it as an argument in `api.createOrder()`, for it to be executed after the order has been created.

const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart, function() {
  api.proceedToPayment();
});
```

> Now that we've given `api.proceedToPayment()` as a callback to `api.createOrder()`, it will be the responsibility of api.createOrder() to call `api.proceedToPayment()` once it is done.

#### Downside: Suppose we want to show an order summary page after payment.

We have an API for that, `api.showOrderSummary()`

```Javascript
// We will do the same thing.
// Wrap the show Order summary page API in a function.

function(){
  api.showOrderSummary();
}

// then pass it into proceed to payment.
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart, function(){

  api.proceedToPayment(function(){
  
      api.showOrderSummary();
  });
})

```

After that, suppose we need to update the wallet, with and API `api.updateWallet()`

```Javascript
api.createOrder(cart, function(){

  api.proceedToPayment(function(){
  
      api.showOrderSummary(function(){
         
         api.updateWallet();
         
      });
  });
})

```

> This is goiing to be problematic, as we continue to add more `APIs`, which are dependant of one after the other. This will lead to a **callback hell**

* **Callback Hell:** This is where the code grows horizontally instead of vertically and becomes hard to read and maintain.

## Inversion of Control:

In this pattern, the developer passes a function as an argument to another function or method, and that function or method will call the passed function at some point in the future. The callback function is thus `"in control"` of when it is called, as opposed to the main program flow.

## Downsied: Inversion of Control

1. Now that we've given our function to another function for execution, we are never sure whether it will be executed or not.
2. We are never sure, what the Higher Order component is doing behind the scenes, (maybe it is poorly written)
