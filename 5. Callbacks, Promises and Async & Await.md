# Callbacks, Promises and Async & Await

## 1. Callback

Javascript is synchronous single threaded languge, and it can only do one thing at a time.
It has only one callstack and it can execute one thing at a time.

```Javascript
console.log("Rodgers");

console.log("Chayuga");

console.log("From Nairobi, Kenya");
```

### Example:
Suppose we are building an E-commerce website.
This needs a Cart.

```Javascript
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

```

> In real world this would be big objects not just array of strings.

#### Steps: How an Ecommerce works.
 * **CREATE ORDER**
 Suppose we have an API that creates an order `api.createOrder()`
 * **PAYMENT**
 and another api to proceed to payment `api.proceedToPayment()`

> Before we can purchase anything, first we need to create an order then we can proceed to payment
> There is a dependency between them.

Having these tow `APIs`:

```Javscript
api.createOrder();
api.proceedToPayment();
```

Callback will come in play, to make it asynchronous, and the way we do it is by wrapping the `api.proceedToPayment()` api in a callback and only be execute if and only if the create order api has executed

```Javascript
// Step No. 1: wrap the `api.proceedToPayment()` in a callback.
// Step No. 2: have as an arguement in `api.createOrder()`, for it to be executed after order has been created.

const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart, function()
{
  api.proceedToPayment();
}
```

> Now that we've given `api.proceedToPayment()` as a callback to `api.createOrder()`, it will be a responsibility of `api.createOrder()` to call `api.proceedToPayment()` once it is done.

#### Downside: Suppose we want to show order summery page after payment.

We have an API for that `api.showOrderSummary()`

```Javascript
// We will do the same thing.
// Wrap the show Order summary page API in a function.

function(){
  api.showOrderSummary();
}

// then pass it into proceed to payment.
const cart = ["Banana", "Oranges", "Apples", "Shoes"]; //Array of items in a Cart.

api.createOrder(cart, function(){

  api.proceedToPayment(function(){
  
      api.showOrderSummary();
  });
})

```

After that, suppose we need to update the wallet, with and API `api.updateWallet()`

```Javascript
api.createOrder(cart, function(){

  api.proceedToPayment(function(){
  
      api.showOrderSummary(function(){
         
         api.updateWallet();
         
      });
  });
})

```

> This is goiing to be problematic, as we continue to add more `APIs`, which are dependant of one after the other. This will lead to a **callback hell**

* **Callback Hell:** This is where a code grows horizontally instead of vertically, and becomes hard to read and maintain.
