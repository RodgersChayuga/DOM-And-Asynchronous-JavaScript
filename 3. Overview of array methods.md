# 3. Overview of array methods:

###1. What are array methods?

**An Array:** Is a data structure that contains a collection of elements, of the same data type, which
can be acceessed by their index positions.

**Array Methods:** are built-in functions in programming languages, such as Javascript, 
that allow for manipulation and management of arrays.

>Array methods provide an easy and efficient way to perform operations on arrays, 
such as adding or removing elements, sorting, filtering, and reducing.


###2. Examples of common array methods in javascript.
* **push() -** Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array.

```Javascript
// Declare an empty array
let myArray = [];

// Add elements to the array using push()
myArray.push("apple");
myArray.push("banana");
myArray.push("cherry");

// Display the array
console.log(myArray); // Output: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
```
